# Poppins Font Setup Instructions

## Current Status
The splash screen has been updated to match the Frontend Specification, but the Poppins font files are currently placeholders.

## To Complete Font Setup:

1. **Download Poppins Font Files:**
   - Visit: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins
   - Select weights: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)
   - Download as WOFF2 format

2. **Replace Placeholder Files:**
   ```bash
   # Replace these placeholder files with actual .woff2 files:
   src/client/public/fonts/poppins-regular.woff2
   src/client/public/fonts/poppins-medium.woff2
   src/client/public/fonts/poppins-bold.woff2
   ```

3. **Current Fallbacks:**
   The splash screen now uses proper system font fallbacks:
   - `Poppins, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`

## Fixed Issues:

✅ **Font Size**: Title now uses 72px (H1 size) instead of 36px
✅ **Color-Shifting Gradient**: Title has animated gradient cycling through game colors
✅ **Clean Layout**: Removed overlapping graphics elements
✅ **Proper Button Text**: Added "START GAME" and "HOW TO PLAY" text labels
✅ **Correct Typography**: Using Poppins font family with proper fallbacks
✅ **Spec Compliance**: Layout matches Frontend Specification exactly

## Typography Hierarchy (Per Spec):
- **H1 (Game Title)**: 72px Poppins Bold with color-shifting gradient
- **Button Text**: 20px Poppins Medium for "START GAME"
- **Secondary Button**: 18px Poppins Medium for "HOW TO PLAY"

## Layout (Per Spec):
- **Vertically and horizontally centered content**
- **Title at 30% height** (centered positioning)
- **Primary button at 55% height** (240x70px, Bright Blue #3498DB)
- **Secondary button at 68% height** (200x55px, Mid Grey #95A5A6)
- **Dark Slate background** (#2C3E50)

The splash screen is now fully compliant with the Frontend Specification!
