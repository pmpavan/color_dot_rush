# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Color Rush splash screen currently has critical responsive design issues where fonts fail to load properly and button interactive areas disappear when the screen resizes. This affects the user experience on mobile devices and when users rotate their devices or resize their browser windows.

## Glossary

- **SplashScreen**: The initial game scene that displays the title, subtitle, and navigation buttons
- **ResponsiveCanvas**: Phaser's responsive canvas system that handles screen size changes
- **GameContainer**: The DOM container element that holds the Phaser canvas
- **InteractiveArea**: The clickable/tappable region of buttons that responds to user input
- **FontPreloader**: System responsible for ensuring fonts are loaded before displaying text
- **DOMText**: Text elements created as DOM elements overlaid on the Phaser canvas
- **PhaserText**: Text elements created using Phaser's built-in text rendering system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the splash screen to display properly with readable fonts immediately when the game loads, so that I can see the game title and buttons clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the splash screen loads, THE SplashScreen SHALL display the Poppins font family with proper fallbacks
2. IF Poppins font is not available, THEN THE SplashScreen SHALL display system fonts without visual degradation
3. THE SplashScreen SHALL preload all required font weights before displaying text elements
4. THE SplashScreen SHALL display all text elements with consistent typography hierarchy
5. THE SplashScreen SHALL complete font loading within 2 seconds of scene initialization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile player, I want the splash screen buttons to remain clickable when I rotate my device, so that I can start the game regardless of orientation changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen orientation changes, THE SplashScreen SHALL update button interactive areas to match new positions
2. WHEN the browser window resizes, THE SplashScreen SHALL recalculate button boundaries and maintain clickability
3. THE SplashScreen SHALL preserve button visual appearance during resize operations
4. THE SplashScreen SHALL maintain proper button spacing and proportions across all screen sizes
5. WHILE resizing occurs, THE SplashScreen SHALL prevent button interaction until layout stabilizes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent visual feedback when interacting with buttons, so that I know my taps are being registered properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a button, THE SplashScreen SHALL provide immediate visual feedback through scaling animation
2. WHEN I tap a button, THE SplashScreen SHALL provide tactile feedback through press animation
3. THE SplashScreen SHALL synchronize button background and text animations during interactions
4. THE SplashScreen SHALL maintain interaction responsiveness across different device types
5. IF a button animation is in progress, THEN THE SplashScreen SHALL queue subsequent interactions appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the splash screen to use a consistent rendering approach, so that text and graphics remain synchronized during responsive changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SplashScreen SHALL use a single rendering system for all visual elements
2. THE SplashScreen SHALL eliminate mixed DOM and Phaser rendering approaches
3. THE SplashScreen SHALL maintain visual consistency during screen size changes
4. THE SplashScreen SHALL provide proper cleanup of all rendering resources
5. THE SplashScreen SHALL optimize rendering performance for mobile devices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player on a slow network, I want the splash screen to display gracefully even if custom fonts fail to load, so that I can still navigate the game interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SplashScreen SHALL implement progressive font loading with immediate fallback display
2. IF font loading exceeds timeout threshold, THEN THE SplashScreen SHALL proceed with system fonts
3. THE SplashScreen SHALL maintain layout integrity regardless of font loading status
4. THE SplashScreen SHALL provide visual loading indicators during font loading process
5. THE SplashScreen SHALL log font loading status for debugging purposes
