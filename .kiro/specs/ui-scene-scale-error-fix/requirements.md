# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'scale')" error that occurs when the UIScene is being destroyed. The error happens in the ResponsiveLayoutManager.destroy() method when it tries to access this.scene.scale, but the scene's scale property is already undefined during the destruction process.

## Glossary

- **UIScene**: The Phaser scene responsible for managing the game's user interface
- **ResponsiveLayoutManager**: Utility class that manages responsive layout calculations and resize handling
- **Scale Property**: Phaser's scale manager that handles screen dimensions and resize events
- **Destroy Method**: Cleanup method called when objects are being destroyed to prevent memory leaks

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game to shut down cleanly without throwing errors, so that the user experience is smooth and no console errors appear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UIScene is being destroyed, THE ResponsiveLayoutManager SHALL safely handle the case where scene.scale is undefined
2. WHEN accessing scene.scale in the destroy method, THE ResponsiveLayoutManager SHALL check if the scale property exists before attempting to use it
3. IF scene.scale is undefined during destruction, THEN THE ResponsiveLayoutManager SHALL skip the scale event listener removal without throwing an error
4. WHEN the destroy method completes, THE ResponsiveLayoutManager SHALL have cleaned up all references regardless of scale availability
5. WHEN the game is restarted after the error fix, THE UIScene SHALL initialize properly without any lingering issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling in all cleanup methods, so that partial destruction states don't cause cascading failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any cleanup method encounters an undefined property, THE system SHALL log a warning and continue with cleanup
2. WHEN the scene is in a partial destruction state, THE ResponsiveLayoutManager SHALL handle missing properties gracefully
3. IF multiple properties are undefined during cleanup, THEN THE destroy method SHALL continue processing all cleanup steps
4. WHEN cleanup encounters errors, THE system SHALL prevent error propagation to parent components
5. WHEN logging cleanup warnings, THE system SHALL provide sufficient detail for debugging without being verbose

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling patterns across all UI utility classes, so that similar issues are prevented in other components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing scene properties in destroy methods, THE system SHALL use safe property access patterns
2. WHEN implementing cleanup logic, THE system SHALL follow defensive programming practices
3. IF other utility classes have similar patterns, THEN THE fix SHALL be applied consistently across all classes
4. WHEN adding error handling, THE system SHALL maintain existing functionality for normal operation
5. WHEN the fix is complete, THE system SHALL have improved resilience against destruction-time errors
