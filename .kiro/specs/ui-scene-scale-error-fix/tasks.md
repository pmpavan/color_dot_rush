# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix ResponsiveLayoutManager destroy method with safe property access

  - Update the destroy() method to check for scene.scale existence before accessing it
  - Add try-catch error handling around scale event listener removal
  - Ensure cleanup continues even if scale operations fail
  - Add structured logging for debugging destruction issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Audit and fix other utility classes for similar destruction issues

  - Review UpdateHandler.destroy() method for safe property access patterns
  - Check UIElementFactory for any scene property access during cleanup
  - Review UIErrorRecovery cleanup methods for defensive programming
  - Apply consistent error handling patterns across all utility classes
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Add comprehensive error handling patterns for scene destruction

  - Create helper method for safe event listener removal
  - Implement structured error logging with context information
  - Add validation for scene state during destruction operations
  - Ensure all cleanup methods handle partial destruction states gracefully
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.4_

- [ ]\* 4. Create unit tests for destruction error scenarios

  - Write tests for ResponsiveLayoutManager.destroy() with undefined scale
  - Test destruction with null scene references
  - Test multiple destroy() calls and partial destruction states
  - Verify cleanup continues even when individual operations fail
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.3, 3.5_

- [x] 5. Test and validate the fix in the game environment
  - Test the specific error scenario that was occurring
  - Verify game restart functionality works properly after the fix
  - Check that no memory leaks occur during destruction
  - Ensure normal operation is unaffected by the error handling additions
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.5, 3.4, 3.5_
