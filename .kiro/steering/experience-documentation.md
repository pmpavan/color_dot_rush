# Experience Documentation Guidelines

## Auto-Documentation Requirements

When working on the Devvit game app, automatically capture:

- **Kiro-Specific Advantages**: How Kiro's features helped vs previous Cursor + BMAD workflow
- **Development Velocity**: Time savings from integrated AI vs manual spec management
- **Workflow Improvements**: Reduced context switching and automated assistance
- Devvit framework learning curve and discoveries
- Reddit API integration challenges and solutions
- Game mechanics adapted for Reddit's UI constraints
- Community engagement and user feedback strategies
- Devvit deployment and subreddit installation process
- Performance within Reddit's platform limitations

## Documentation Format

- Use clear timestamps for development milestones
- Include code snippets for key implementations
- Document both successes and failures for learning
- Capture performance metrics and benchmarks
- Note user feedback and iterations

## Panel Presentation Preparation

All documentation should be structured for easy conversion to presentation format:

- **Kiro vs Cursor + BMAD comparison** with specific advantages and metrics
- Executive summary of development process
- Key technical achievements enabled by Kiro
- Challenges overcome with AI assistance
- Lessons learned about integrated AI development
- Development velocity and efficiency metrics
