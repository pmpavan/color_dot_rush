What phase am I in? (Red: writing failing test, Green: making test pass, Refactor: improving code)\n3. How is Kiro helping with this TDD cycle vs how I would have done this in Cursor + BMAD?\n4. Any challenges with testing Devvit-specific functionality?\n5. How are SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles being applied in this implementation?\n6. What code duplication was eliminated or simplicity improvements made?\n\nThen update the docs/development-journal.md with this TDD progress, highlighting how Kiro's integrated assistance improves the test-first development workflow and code quality principles for the panel presentation."
