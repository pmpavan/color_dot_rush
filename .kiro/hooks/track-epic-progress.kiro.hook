(Epic 1: Core Gameplay, Epic 2: Player Experience, Epic 3: Strategic Elements, Epic 4: Reddit Integration)\n2. Which specific user story within that epic?\n3. How did Kiro help with this implementation vs how I would have approached it in Cursor + BMAD?\n4. Any challenges with Devvit constraints or Color Rush requirements?\n5. Performance or quality considerations from the QA review?\n\nThen update the docs/development-journal.md with this progress, specifically highlighting Kiro's advantages and development velocity improvements for the panel presentation."
