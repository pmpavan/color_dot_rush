## Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy Your Devvit App

First, make sure your Color Dot Rush app is deployed and accessible:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Note your app's URL (e.g., `https://your-app.devvit.app`).

### 2. Set Up GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. **Copy the workflow file**:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/github-actions-weekly-leaderboard.yml .github/workflows/weekly-leaderboard.yml
   ```

2. **Add secrets to your GitHub repository**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `DEVVIT_APP_URL`: Your deployed Devvit app URL
     - `DEVVIT_API_KEY`: (Optional) API key if authentication is required

3. **Enable the workflow**:
   - The workflow will automatically run every Monday at 9 AM UTC
   - You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab

### 3. Alternative: External Cron Service

If you prefer not to use GitHub Actions, you can use any external cron service:

#### Using a VPS/Server:
```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every Monday at 9 AM UTC)
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/color-rush && node scripts/weekly-leaderboard-cron.js --execute
```

#### Using AWS Lambda:
1. Create a Lambda function with the cron script
2. Set up EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) to trigger every Monday
3. Configure environment variables for your Devvit app URL

#### Using other services:
- **Vercel Cron Jobs**: Use Vercel's cron functionality
- **Railway**: Use Railway's cron jobs
- **Heroku Scheduler**: Use Heroku's add-on

## API Endpoints

The system provides several endpoints for monitoring and manual execution:

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Execute weekly leaderboard post immediately
curl -X POST https://your-app.devvit.app/internal/weekly-leaderboard-post

# Execute all scheduled tasks
curl -X POST https://your-app.devvit.app/internal/execute-scheduled-tasks
```

### Status Checking
```bash
# Check if it's time to post
curl https://your-app.devvit.app/internal/weekly-leaderboard-status

# Check scheduled tasks status
curl https://your-app.devvit.app/internal/scheduled-tasks-status
```

## Post Content Format

The system generates engaging posts with the following structure:

```
üèÜ Weekly Color Dot Rush Leaderboard - [Date Range]

## üéØ Top Players This Week

## Configuration

### Timing Configuration

The system posts every Monday between 9 AM and 11 AM. You can modify this in:

- **Server**: `src/server/core/weeklyLeaderboardPost.ts` - `shouldPostWeeklyLeaderboard()` function
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/weekly-leaderboard.yml` - cron schedule
- **External Cron**: Your cron configuration

### Content Customization

You can customize the post content by modifying:

- **Post Template**: `src/server/core/weeklyLeaderboardPost.ts` - `generateWeeklyPostContent()` function
- **Leaderboard Size**: Change the number of top players shown (default: 20)
- **Statistics**: Add or modify weekly statistics
- **Engagement Text**: Customize the call-to-action and instructions

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check System Status

```bash
# Check if system is working
node scripts/weekly-leaderboard-cron.js --status

# Force execution for testing
node scripts/weekly-leaderboard-cron.js --execute
```

### Common Issues

1. **No leaderboard data**: 
   - Check if players have submitted scores
   - Verify Redis connection and data storage

2. **Post creation fails**:
   - Check Reddit API permissions
   - Verify subreddit access and posting permissions

3. **Scheduling issues**:
   - Check timezone settings
   - Verify cron schedule or GitHub Actions timing

### Logs and Debugging

The system provides comprehensive logging:

- **Server logs**: Check your Devvit app logs for detailed execution information
- **GitHub Actions logs**: View execution logs in the Actions tab
- **Cron logs**: Check your system logs for cron execution

## Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test the cron script locally
DEVVIT_APP_URL=https://your-app.devvit.app node scripts/weekly-leaderboard-cron.js --execute

# Test specific endpoints
curl -X POST https://your-app.devvit.app/internal/weekly-leaderboard-post
```

### Production Testing

1. **Test with small data**: Use a test subreddit with limited data
2. **Verify post format**: Check that posts appear correctly formatted
3. **Monitor performance**: Ensure the system completes within timeout limits

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Store sensitive credentials in environment variables or secrets
- **Rate Limiting**: The system respects Reddit's API rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Failed posts don't crash the system
- **Data Privacy**: Only public leaderboard data is posted

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Multiple Subreddits**: Post to multiple subreddits where the app is installed
2. **Custom Templates**: Allow subreddit-specific post templates
3. **Analytics**: Track post engagement and player response
4. **Awards**: Integrate with Reddit awards system
5. **Seasonal Events**: Special posts for holidays or special events

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Verify your Devvit app is deployed and accessible
3. Test the endpoints manually
4. Check Reddit API permissions and subreddit access
