# Onboarding Implementation

## Overview
The onboarding system provides a tutorial experience for first-time users of Color Dot Rush. It shows them how to play the game with interactive steps and visual highlights.

## Components

### 1. OnboardingService (`src/client/services/OnboardingService.ts`)
- Manages first-time user detection using localStorage
- Tracks onboarding completion status
- Provides onboarding step definitions with visual demonstrations
- Handles persistence of user state

### 2. OnboardingTutorial (`src/client/game/utils/OnboardingTutorial.ts`)
- Interactive tutorial component using DOM overlay
- Neon-styled UI matching the game theme
- Step-by-step guidance with visual highlights
- **Visual dot demonstrations** showing actual game elements
- Animated demo dots with pulsing effects
- Auto-advance and manual navigation options

### 3. Game Integration (`src/client/game/scenes/Game.ts`)
- Checks for first-time users after UI initialization
- Starts onboarding tutorial automatically
- Integrates with existing game flow

## How It Works

1. **First Launch Detection**: When the game starts, it checks if the user is a first-time player
2. **Tutorial Display**: If first-time, shows an interactive tutorial with 6 steps:
   - Welcome message with colored dot examples
   - Target color explanation with matching dots
   - Score system
   - Bomb avoidance with visual bomb demonstration
   - Slow-motion dots with special effect demonstration
   - Ready to play
3. **Visual Highlights**: Tutorial highlights specific UI elements during explanation
4. **Visual Demonstrations**: Shows animated demo dots that look like actual game elements
5. **Completion Tracking**: Marks onboarding as completed to prevent showing again

## Testing

### Reset Onboarding (for testing)
```javascript
// In browser console
OnboardingTestHelper.resetOnboardingForTesting();
```

### Check Status
```javascript
// In browser console
OnboardingTestHelper.getOnboardingStatus();
```

### Force Show Onboarding
```javascript
// In browser console
OnboardingTestHelper.forceShowOnboarding();
```

## User Experience

- **First-time users**: See the tutorial automatically after clicking "Play Game"
- **Returning users**: Skip directly to the game
- **Tutorial can be skipped**: Users can skip the tutorial at any time
- **Visual demonstrations**: See actual game elements during the tutorial
- **Animated examples**: Demo dots pulse and animate to show what to expect
- **Non-intrusive**: Tutorial doesn't interfere with game mechanics
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## Technical Details

- Uses localStorage for persistence
- DOM-based overlay for better performance
- Integrates with existing DOMTextRenderer system
- **Visual demo system**: Creates animated Phaser graphics for dot demonstrations
- **Multiple dot types**: Normal dots, bombs, and slow-motion dots with distinct visuals
- Neon theme styling matches game aesthetics
- Proper cleanup on scene shutdown
