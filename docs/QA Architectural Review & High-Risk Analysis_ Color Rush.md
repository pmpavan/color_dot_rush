| **Project:**        | Color Rush        |
| **Document Owner:** | Quality Assurance |
| **Status:**         | Finalized         |
| **Date:**           | October 17, 2025  |

#### **1\. Overview**

This document provides a proactive quality assurance analysis of the project's planning and architectural documents. The goal is to identify high-risk areas early and propose strategies to mitigate these risks through targeted testing and built-in testability.

#### **2\. High-Risk Areas & Proposed Test Strategies**

##### **Area 1: Dynamic Difficulty Scaling (High Risk)**

- **The Risk:** The game's enjoyability is critically dependent on the exponential formulas for difficulty. The variables baseSpeed, growthRate, baseSize, and shrinkRate are highly sensitive. Incorrect tuning can make the game unplayable or boring.
- **Impact:** High. A poor difficulty curve is a critical gameplay failure.
- **Test Strategy & Mitigation:**
  1. **Prioritize the Debug Panel:** The QA team's top priority is to verify the functionality of the debug panel. This tool is essential for live-tuning the difficulty formula variables during playtesting.
  2. **Formula Verification:** Testers must verify that the implemented code for speed \= baseSpeed \* growthRate^t and size \= baseSize \* shrinkRate^t behaves as mathematically expected.
  3. **Establish "Golden Path" Metrics:** Define target metrics (e.g., "an average player should survive for 45 seconds") to provide a concrete goal for the tuning process.

##### **Area 2: Input Precision & Hit Registration (High Risk)**

- **The Risk:** The core mechanic involves tapping small, fast-moving targets. Perceived "misses" are a major source of player frustration. Hitbox accuracy and input latency are critical.
- **Impact:** High. If players feel the controls are unfair, they will abandon the game.
- **Test Strategy & Mitigation:**
  1. **Visualize Hitboxes:** The debug mode that visually renders the tappable hitboxes for all game objects must be tested to ensure the logical tap area is larger than the visual sprite, providing a "fat finger" tolerance.
  2. **Cross-Device Testing:** The game must be tested on a range of physical mobile devices (not just emulators) to check for input lag or performance issues on lower-end hardware.

##### **Area 3: Devvit API & Backend Integration (Medium Risk)**

- **The Risk:** The leaderboard functionality depends on an external service (Reddit/Devvit API). Network latency, API errors, or authentication issues can break this feature.
- **Impact:** Medium. A failing leaderboard will frustrate competitive players, but the core game remains playable.
- **Test Strategy & Mitigation:**
  1. **Test Against the Mock API Service:** The UI must be tested against a mock LeaderboardService that simulates various API responses: success, slow response, error codes, and empty data.
  2. **Graceful Degradation:** Verify that the leaderboard screen shows a clear "Could not load scores" message during network timeouts and does not crash on unexpected API responses.

#### **3\. Summary & Recommendation**

The project architecture is sound. Proactively addressing these high-risk areas will ensure a high-quality, polished, and robust final product.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize the implementation and testing of the **Debug Panel**. This tool is a force multiplier that will accelerate the critical task of balancing the game's difficulty curve.
