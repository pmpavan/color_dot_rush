Project Hub: Color Rush

Welcome to the central documentation hub for Color Rush, a fast-paced reflex game being developed for the Reddit Community Games 2025 hackathon.

This document serves as the starting point for all team members. It provides a brief overview of the project and directs you to the detailed documentation you need for your specific role. All project documents are finalized and ready for the development phase.

Project Overview

Color Rush is a minimalist, "just one more try" game where players must tap the correct colored dots while avoiding bombs and wrong colors. The game's difficulty increases exponentially over time, and a Reddit-integrated leaderboard fosters community competition.
