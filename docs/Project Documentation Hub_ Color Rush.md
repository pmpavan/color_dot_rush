# **Project Documentation Hub: Color Rush**

Welcome to the central documentation hub for **Color Rush**, a reflex-based game for the Reddit Community Games 2025\. This repository contains all the necessary planning documents to guide the project from concept to completion.

### **Project Summary**

Color Rush is a minimalist, high-energy reflex game where players must tap the correct "Target Color" dot while avoiding bombs and other colors. The game's difficulty scales dynamically over time, and a limited "Slow-Mo" power-up adds a strategic layer. The project is designed for the Reddit Devvit platform, with a core focus on community competition via an integrated leaderboard.
